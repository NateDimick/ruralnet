# Project History 

Ed Childs raised the need for a solution help Corinth make a case for improved internet infrastructure. This was initially based on following the approach that was successful for Newbury.

We quickly realized many towns were facing a similar issue:  
to make a case for funding infrastructure improvement, they had to demonstrate that current ISP speed claims were misleading or failed to reflect experienced speeds.

--- 

# Project Goals

- Develop a web-application that can measure a user's internet speed easily while:
  - Respecting privacy (aggregated location); taking into account measurement variability (repeat testing, etc); making it easy to map measured speeds
- Survey users about their internet experience and satisfaction

---

# "Deliverables"

1. Speed-test web-app
2. User survey + results
3. Publicly available map comparing measured speeds to ISP reported speeds (Arlene)

---

# Current Approach

- Single-page-application built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev)
- Backend using [LibreSpeed](https://github.com/librespeed/speedtest/tree/72cccd061961a7b3e2359e01b8d6a286a14a9450) for measurement
  - User downloads/upload random bytes of increasing size to measure speed
- Location gathered via Mapquest API
- Data stored in [Mongodb Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud) (cloud database)
- App served via [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com) (auto-deploys from github)

# Project Needs

- [Github project board](https://github.com/codeforUV/ruralnet/projects/2)
  - general code cleanup; fixing some speedtest issues; styling webapp (Jennifer)
- Survey content finalization + integration with app logic and database
- Map generation
- Testing, testing, testing
